# About Project
1. Initially I downloaded the [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) [survey_data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) from their free available public repository.
2. Since the data comes in two CSV files first being raw data and second CSV file explaning feilds or questions asked during survey, so I had to clean the survey data. But the issue while 
uploading survey data on github was it's size, so rather than uploading here I have given the link for you to download easliy [stackoverflow 2019 survey data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
3. After cleaning all the data, I had to rearrange row and columns to get working properly, to many python libraries and methods were used.
4. After cleaning all data I extracted two three columns, 1. All developers from around the world, 2. Python users from each country 3. Java user from each country
5. All these was available in groups and from groups I had to convert it into series and then DataFrame
6. Finally after successful completion graph was plotted
